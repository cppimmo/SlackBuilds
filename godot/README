Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create
2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive
set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without
having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to
a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux,
macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based
platforms and consoles.

Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT
license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Users' games are
theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is
fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to help shape
their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the Godot
Foundation not-for-profit.

The Godot Engine uses the Scons build system which is included in a
Slackware installation.

To use Clang instead of GCC:
USE_LLVM=yes LINKER=lld ./godot.SlackBuild

To enable link-time optimization (GCC only; requires 7GB of unused RAM):
USE_LTO=yes ./godot.SlackBuild

To use optional libudev dependency:
USE_UDEV=yes ./godot.SlackBuild

To build documentation as well (delimit using commas):
DOC=doxygen,rst,rstjs ./godot.SlackBuild

To build Godot for production use (PRODUCTION=yes enables LTO):
TARGET=template_release PRODUCTION=yes ./godot.SlackBuild

Available targets include:
  editor (Default build with editor, optimized, with debugging code ()
  Use for running projects:
    template_debug (Build with C++ debugging symbols, no editor)
    template_release (Build without symbols, no editor)
