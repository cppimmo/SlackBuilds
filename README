SlackBuilds
===========
A repository for SlackBuild scripts that I create. SlackBuilds are software
package scripts used for Slackware systems. Dependencies must be retrieved
manually. Some packages may be either binary or source packages.

Included Packages
=================
- cglm
- xwallpaper
- libticonv
- libtifiles
- libticables
- libticalcs
- tilp
- gfm

How to Build
============
You can build these in bulk with the following commands:
$ chmod +x distribute.sh
$ sudo ./distribute.sh --build-all

This will place tarballs of the SlackBuild directories in a ./build directory.
It will also build every package and generate the binaries that you can install
using the following commands:
$ sudo installpkg whatever_package-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
	or
$ sudo upgradepkg --install-new whatever_package-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
		
Disclaimer
==========
These are currently not official packages; install at your own risk. No
warranty.
