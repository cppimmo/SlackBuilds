# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

i8kutils: ik8utils is a utility that controls the system temperature of some
i8kutils: Dell laptops via the system fans. It was developed for the I8000 
i8kutils: series, but now supports more dell products. It was not implemented 
i8kutils: based on Dell documentation so it is not guarnteed to work on all
i8kutils: models. Dell did not contribute to this project with documentation.
